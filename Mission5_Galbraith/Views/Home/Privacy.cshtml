    <p1>If you are wanting to learn how to surf, it is your lucky day! I can teach you how :). I do charge however, haha it is not 
        always an easy thing to teach. I also have to cover costs to fly to and from Cabo. No worries, I try to make the price as fair as possible.
        Use this handy dandy calculator of mine. Notice the hourly rate. Based on that rate, enter the number of hours you would like to spend learning 
        and I will calculate what the total will be.
